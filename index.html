          <p>You gotta keep 'em separated<br>
          Like the latest fashion<br>
          Like a spreading disease<br>
          The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom<br>
          Getting weapons with the greatest of ease<br>
          The gangs stake their own campus locale<br>
          And if they catch you slippin' then it's all over pal<br>
          If one guy's colors and the others don't mix<br>
          They're gonna bash it up, bash it up, bash it up, bash it up<br>
          Hey, man you talkin' back to me?<br>
          Take him out<br>
          You gotta keep 'em separated<br>
          Hey, man you disrespecting me?<br>
          Take him out<br>
          You gotta keep 'em separated<br>
          Hey, they don't pay no mind<br>
          If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time<br>
          Hey, come out and play<br>
          By the time you hear the siren<br>
          It's already too late<br>
          One goes to the morgue and the other to jail<br>
          One guy wasted and the other's a waste<br>
          It goes down the same as the thousand before<br>
          No one's getting smarter, no one's learning the score<br>
          Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate<br>
          Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own<br>
          Hey, man you disrespecting me?<br>
          Take him out<br>
          You gotta keep 'em separated<br>
          Hey, man you talkin' back to me?<br>
          Take him out<br>
          You gotta keep 'em separated<br>
          Hey, they don't pay no mind<br>
          If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time<br>
          Hey, come out and play<br>
          It goes down the same as the thousand before<br>
          No one's getting smarter, no one's learning the score<br>
          Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate<br>
          Is gonna tie your own rope, tie your own rope, tie your own<br>
          Hey, man you talkin' back to me?<br>
          Take him out<br>
          You gotta keep 'em separated<br>
          Hey, man you disrespecting me?<br>
          Take him out<br>
          You gotta keep 'em separated<br>
          Hey, they don't pay no mind<br>
          If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time<br>
          Hey, come out and play </p>
